# Employee-tracker

## I had to make an employee tracker using Node.js, Inquirer, and Mysql. I had to make a data base from scratch inputing employees, roles and departments.

## You will need to copy my github repo and clone it to your machine and then be able to look at my code.

## If you need help making data for your employees you can use my code to help with that, or if you need to look at a code to make one yourself you can look at mine for an example.

## I had help from my teacher and my TA, also from ww3 schools and AskABC.




## Here is a video of how it work. https://watch.screencastify.com/v/KF2tFrjznELZVmiasTPE
